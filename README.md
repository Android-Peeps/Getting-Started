 **DEFINE** :

1 .  **Java**  Java is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed environment of the internet. It is the most popular programming language for Android smartphone applications and is among the most favored for edge device and internet of things development.2. AndroidAndroid is a software package and linux based operating system for mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. It is developed by Google and later the OHA (Open Handset Alliance). Java language is mainly used to write the android code and its app, even though other languages can be usedMain Features of JAVA1. Java is a platform independent language2.

### Trending

 **Java Vs Kotlin ?** 

Simply why? Java is great and once you master Java, Kotlin will be easy as hell to understand, I recommend learning Java first, later move to Kotlin and HI, we are here for Java remember? so lets start...... KThanXBye KotLin xD

 **If you want to make an Android App:-** 

Android Studio [https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

### Procedure

 In the Welcome to Android Studio window, click Start a new Android Studio project.

Or if you have a project opened, select File > New Project.


In the Create New Project window, enter the following values:Application Name: "My First App"

Company Domain: "example.com"

Click Next.

 In the Target Android Devices screen, keep the default values and click Next.

In the Add an Activity to Mobile screen, select Empty Activity and click Next.

In the Configure Activity screen, keep the default values and click Finish.

app > java > com.example.myfirstapp > MainActivity

This is the main activity (the entry point for your app). When you build and run the app, the system launches an instance of this Activity and loads its layout.

app > res > layout > activity_main.xml

This XML file defines the layout for the activity's UI. It contains a TextView element with the text "Hello world!".

app > manifests > AndroidManifest.xml

The manifest file describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components.

Gradle Scripts > build.gradle

You'll see two files with this name: one for the project and one for the "app" module. Each module has its own build.gradle file, but this project currently has just one module. You'll mostly work with the module's build.gradle file to configure how the Gradle tools compile and build your app.

Lets run our app

In Android Studio, click the app module in the Project window and then select Run > Run (or click Run  in the toolbar).

Done, Select your Virtual Device or Your Android Phone ( Turn on USB DEBUGGING )
NOTE : Enable USB debugging in the Developer options as follows.First, you must enable the developer options:

Open the Settings app.

(Only on Android 8.0 or higher) Select System.

Scroll to the bottom and select About phone.

Scroll to the bottom and tap Build number 7 times.

Return to the previous screen to find Developer options near the bottom.

Open Developer options, and then scroll down to find and enable USB debugging.

Hurrah! We have successfully compiled our first very own Android Application ;p

 **LOGCATS** 

Android Studios logcat is a crucial part of the debug process when things don't go according to plan, as it indicates exactly what went wrong, and importantly, the lines of code that caused the unexpected behaviour. It's a powerful tool that you really need to get to grips with. Have a look at this Link for more:
